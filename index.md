<p id="describe-text">Welcome. I hope you're doing well.</p>
<br>
My name's Henry. This is the site I show people so that they'll hire me.

I'm an aspiring developer and currently studying computer science at the University of Texas at Dallas. I specialize in C++ and Java programming, but also have experience in web development and games programming.

You can find examples of my work on the [projects page](/projects) or over on my [GitHub](https://github.com/henrywerner). If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out to my email.
